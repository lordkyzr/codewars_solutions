# Branden Jordan Codewars Solutions
These are the solutions that I had for codewars katas. I added a bunch of these at the same time after realizing I should probably put the answers on Github. I do these when I have some spare time and feel like flexing my coding prowess. I hope by keeping the answers in a repository I will look at my past code in 5 years and see how much better I have become at coding. Codewars does not require any kind of style so the code is not going to be some glamorous code style, they are just small exercises that do simple tasks. I do these mainly to learn new languages and solve them in my main language and then try and figure out how to do that in another language. Languages you will find in here is python, javascript, and golang. 

# Structure
I will be creating folders for each KYU level and then the name of the Kata will be the next folder with the answer. Kata are ranked ranked from 1 - 8 with 1 being the hardest and 8 being the easiest.

Katas ranked 1 - 2 signify proficient use of a language
Katas ranked 3 - 4 signify competence with a language
Katas ranked 5 - 6 signify novice skills with a language
Katas ranked 7 - 8 signify beginner skills with a language
